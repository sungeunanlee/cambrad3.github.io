# Project Title: Predicting NBA Career Performance Based on Rookie Season
## Sungeun An, Nazanin Anaraki, Cameron Bradley, Kevin Cho, Kalyan Chakravarthi Murahari

### Introduction
#### What are we trying to accomplish?
Forecast a player’s career win shares (number of wins attributable to a player) per season based on their rookie metrics.

#### Why is it important?
NBA teams win or lose games based on the number of win shares their players create. Being able to predict the career performance of a player in their rookie season is important to team management because it allows them to make better draft, trade, and personnel decisions to give their organization the best opportunity of winning a championship.

### Data

#### What are its characteristics?
- All players who were rookies between 1980 through 2018 were included in the dataset.
- Each row (2,217) corresponds to an individual player.
- The features include 23 rookie metrics and 20 career metrics.
- Features include information about player efficiency rating, true shooting percentage, 3 point attempt rate, free throw attempt rate, rebound percentage, block percentage, assist percentage, steal percentage, etc. (see Appendix - Glossary of Features) 

### What is Our Approach?
The approach was 2 fold...

#### Unsupervised
We used clustering analysis to find groups of seasoned players (10+ years in the NBA) to which to compare rookie players. To do this we found 2 new features, using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), that reduced the dimensions of the rookie and career features into single metrics. These new features were correlated with rookie and career win shares, and used for clustering analysis.

#### Supervised
The main purpose of supervised learning in our project is to predict the career winshares of a player by using their rookie data. We went through different analysis approaches to pick the most important features in the rookie matrix. Furthermore these features were used by various models. Further analysis was done by comparing the RMSE, R-squared and Mean Absolute Error values generated by these models.  

#### What is new in our approach?
Using LDA to create new features that reduced the dimensions of the rookie and career features into single metrics, and then using these metrics to predict career performance is novel in our approach.

### Unsupervised
#### Creating new features
1) Created a new variable, **rookie win shares classifier**. This variable had a value of 0 if the player’s rookie win shares were 1 standard deviation below the mean, 1 if the player’s rookie win shares were within a standard deviation of the mean, and 2 if the player’s rookie win shares were 1 standard deviation above the mean.

2) For players who were not rookies in 2018, we created a similar metric for **normalized career win shares** (divided by number of years played in the NBA).

3) Using the rookie win shares classifier as a label, we used **LDA** as a dimension reduction technique to find a **linear combination of the rookie features** that were **predictive of rookie win shares**.

4) We also created a **LDA** model for **normalized career win shares**.

5) The first component of the rookie LDA model and the first component of the career LDA model were used as a new set of features for clustering analysis. The **first components** were chosen because they are the features **most responsible in their models for maximizing win share class separability**.

#### LDA features and original features correlations
The following plot shows how the original rookie and career features are correlated with the values of the chosen LDA components.

#### 9 classes

With the 2 new components derived from the 2 LDA models, we plotted all NBA players since 1980 who were not rookies in 2018, with their respective labels.

1) The **x axis** corresponds to the value of the **first component** that was derived from the **LDA model for duration normalized career win shares**.

2) The **y axis** corresponds to the value of the **first component** that was derived from the **LDA model for rookie win shares**.

3) The colors corresponds to the original **0 (Bad), 1 (Avg), and 2 (Good)** classification values created in the **career (C)** and **rookie (R)** win shares classifier variables. Combinations of the original 2 classification variable values creates **9 total classes**.

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wbfkwx7tncpufpy/nonrookieldaplot.png?raw=1">

This plot shows that the two LDA are **positively correlated with each other**, and they are **positively correlated with rookie/career win shares**.

#### Seasoned players: 6 classes
Rather than compare 2018 rookie players to other players who have had a few years in the league, it is more interesting to compare rookies to players who have had long careers in the league; there is more information about these players.  In this spirit, we reran the LDA analysis for players with 10+ years in the league. The following plot shows the results of this analysis.

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkwnih7gihuaikp/seasonedplayersldaplot.png?raw=1">

Only focusing on seasoned players (10+ year NBA careers) **reduces the number of classes represented from 9 to 6**; there are not many seasoned players with low career win shares per year. Those types of players usually don’t make it 10+ years in the league.

#### Clustering

Because we know seasoned players represent 6 unique classes, **we chose to use clustering algorithms that resulted in 6 clusters**. In K-means and GMM we explicitly set the number of cluster centers equal to 6. In hierarchical based clustering we pruned the dendrogram to have 6 clusters. In DBSCAN we adjusted epsilon and min points such that 6 clusters resulted.
The following sections show the results of each clustering method used. We then provide an evaluation of the 4 clustering methods.

#### Kmeans

For K-means we initialized centers 25 times and picked the clustering that minimized within cluster distances and maximized between cluster distances. The graph below depicts the 6 resulting clusters. **Hall of Fame players with amazing rookie seasons**, such as **Allen Iverson**, were clustered in the upper right portion of the graph, while **less accomplished players** such as **Vitaly Potapenko** appeared in the bottom left of the graph. The players listed in the center of their clusters represent the players closest to their cluster’s mean.

#### Comparison of rookie players to seasoned players

To compare rookie players from the 2018 season to players with 10+ years in the league, we used the seasoned player’s rookie LDA model to get component values for 2018 rookie players in 2018. We then plotted rookie players on a line, on the y axis, at this value.

In the plot above, for example, **Luka Dončić**, has a LDA component value from the seasoned rookie LDA model of 4.73, highest among 2018 rookies. If Luka plays for 10+ years in the league, his career metric would be plotted along the gray line. Although, it is possible for him to end up in the blue, black, or orange cluster (unlikely because no player with his rookie performance has before been included in these clusters), **Luka will most likely be included in the pink cluster (where many greats of the game are located)**.

This information is useful to the Dallas Mavericks, Luka’s current team, because it helps them know how to value their player.

#### Gaussian Mixture Model

GMM is a soft classifier, where every point has a probability of being included in a cluster. Points were assigned to clusters based on its maximum probability across all its probabilities of belonging to a certain cluster.

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xgdr3421y2ovesq/gmmplot.png?raw=1">

The clustering results appear similar to Kmeans, however, some of the players located closest to their cluster means are on the periphery of the soft assignments.

This plot shows that Trae Young (who ironically the Atlanta Hawks traded for by trading away Luka) will most likely be in the green cluster with Brook Lopez. However, there is a chance he could also end up in the black or red clusters.

•	What does the distribution of rookie winshares look like?
Before further discussing the project, we used basic EDA to see what our data can tell us. First, I took a quick look at the distribution of rookie win shares:

•	What does the distribution of Career winshares look like?
Again, we used basic EDA to see what our data can tell us:
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i2y8u7ndwolg919/carrer.PNG?raw=1">

We can see that the distribution of win shares is skewed to the right. This makes sense since The very good NBA players have very high win shares. For example, the win shares leader of our data set is Karl Malone, with 234 win shares. So, it’s an elite status to have a high win shares.
Furthermore, by comparing the 2 charts, we realize that the range of career winshares is lot bigger than the rooki winshares. This makes sense since the career winshare values are created by adding the winshares of a player during their career. This observation resulted in our approach to take into consideration the “duration” of career, while calculating winshares. 


kalyan's stuff:
The correlation matrix is shown below. By analyzing it, we picked the features that correlated the most to the winshares.

#### Evaluation of approach
Nazanin, Kevin, Kalyan

The RMSE, R-squared and Mean Absolute Error values were used to compare the performance of different models.
->RMSE and R-squared comparison goes here

After analysis and comparison between different models, we picked the best model for further analysis on players. In this approach We picked 10 players and predicted their corresponding career winshares, using their rookie features for the selected model. Furthermore, we used these predicted winshares, and predicted which player in our current dataset they will most likely have the closest winshares to, in their future career.-> I need to revise this sentence.
